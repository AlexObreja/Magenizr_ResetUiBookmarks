# Magenizr ResetUiBookmarks
Reset UI Bookmarks becomes an invaluable tool while working daily in the admin panel, especially on MagentoÂ® instances with a large catalogue. The regular use of grid filters, applied sorting ( e.g `Sales > Orders or Catalog > Product` ) or other options provided by third party integrations can cause server time-outs ( depending on the filter combinations ) and make the grid tables unusable. With Reset UI Bookmarks any admin user can reset their filters back to default without having an agency support team involved.

## Business Value
Usually a technical person ( e.g developer ) is required to reset those filters back to default. This can be annoying for a client and create unnecessarily noise for a developer team. Here are the advantages of Reset UI Bookmarks.

* A client can reset filters and column positions back to default. A developer is not required.
* A client support team, which usually has no access to the MySQL database can fix broken grid tables without having a developer involved.
* Practical for small businesses, which can not afford expensive agency support.

## Features
* A red button `Reset UI Bookmarks` is available on the `Account Settings` page for each admin user.
* Once a admin user hits the button `Reset UI Bookmarks`, it will clear the history of state of filters, column positions or applied sorting which are stored in the MySQL table `ui_bookmark`.
* It doesn't delete any other data related to the grid.

## Usage
Simply hit the button `Reset UI Bookmarks` to clear the bookmarks and wait for the confirmation `Your UI bookmarks were cleared successfully`. After that all filters and grid settings are set back to default. More details are available in the attached user guide.
